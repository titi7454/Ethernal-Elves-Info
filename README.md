I'm building my first app in React to get some experience working with it. 
It's use case is to get data from different APIs in one place so you don't have to go and search all over the web.
You can get currently see the floor price of the 2 collections and explore the holders' wallets.

The website uses React.js/CSS (I'm also trying to improve my CSS skills)

To run the project you need to:

->npm build

and then

->npm start


The design is inspired by https://etherorcs-spy.vercel.app/

I also got help from https://github.com/huskystudios/ (One of the creator of EthernalElves)
